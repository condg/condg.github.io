## Sponsorship opportunities

The Central Ohio .NET Developers Group (CONDG) works completely off of donations from members
and sponsor companies. Our operating costs are primarily used to pay any costs related to hosting our
website (including domain name), mailing lists, and to pay for the monthly food and drinks at the
meetings. The money may also be used to pay for special presenters, special events, or special door
prizes.

We strive to provide the best available speakers for the user group presentations and we cannot allow
sponsorship to dictate the speaker choices. We ask that you understand this as you consider you level of
sponsorship.

### Sponsorships levels

We offer several levels of sponsorship:

**Presence Sponsorship** - Recruiters, sales people, and other professionals looking to network with our
members are welcome to attend any of the meetings. We ask that you hand out only business cards.
Flyers, invitations, etc. are reserved for paid sponsors.

**Individual Sponsorship/Donation** - This is simply a donation to CONDG, usually from an individual, but
company donations are gladly accepted.

There are no Sponsorship level benefits associated with a donation, except for the thanks of the CONDG members.
Please remember that CONDG is an Ohio registered Non Profit organization, not federal.

**Prize Sponsorship** - You may donate any amount of giveaways that amount to at least $50 in value.
These giveaways will be raffled off at a meeting of our choosing. The group organizers will make a
special announcement that the item was donated by your organization. You are also welcome to
provide a single flyer to be placed on a table in the foyer of the meeting area

**Meeting Sponsorship** - For the cost of $600 a year (limited to the first eight sponsors), your company
may sponsor food and drink purchases for our monthly meetings. Your company will be highlighted as
an ongoing sponsor of the user group during the pre-meeting slide deck for the CONDG calendar year
(Jan - Dec). During each meeting, we will allow one sponsor to introduce their company to the user
group. Once payment has been received, your company will be given a first come, first served choice of
one meeting in which to give a five (5) minute company presentation. Your company logo will also be on
a static or rotating banner on our website. Additionally, you may bring a single flyer to be laid on a table
in the foyer of the meeting area.

**Annual Sponsorship** - For the cost of $1500 a year (limited to two sponsors), your company will be
entitled to all the benefits of meeting sponsorship listed above as well as two times a year, CONDG will 
mail out an HTML email on your behalf announcing something special your company is doing or any
special recruiting needs you may have. Under no circumstances will sponsors be given access to the
email distribution list.

Special Note: Because the Annual and Meeting sponsorships are limited to the first groups to respond,
near the end of the calendar year, those companies with current sponsorships will be given one month
for the first rights to continue the same level of sponsorship from year to year. After that month expires,
any sponsorships slots that are available will be offered to the next wait listed sponsor for that level.

**Special Speaker Sponsorship** - You may work together with the CONDG board to arrange to bring in a
special speaker to the group. This might be where you already have a well-known expert in town that
you have engaged for your own internal project. We will individually recognize you as the organization
that made it possible for us to bring in the special speaker in the pre-meeting slide deck as well as during
the Swag giveaways. All travel and expenses are the responsibility of the sponsor organization as the
cost of Sponsorship.

**In-Kind Sponsorship** - Sometimes companies or individuals may provide a special service to
the CONDG group which will earn them Honorary Sponsorship benefits. This includes companies like
Microsoft who have been graciously providing us with a place to hold our meeting free of charge.

In-Kind Sponsors receive benefits as determined by the directors of CONDG, on a case by case basis.
Sponsorship payments can be made via invoice or credit card. Please contact us to make arrangements.
You can see our list of current sponsors on our Sponsors page.

**Job Postings** - Our current policy is to not allow job postings or announcements on our site or at our
meetings.

**Questions?** - If you have any questions about sponsorship opportunities, please [contact us](/contact).

These policies are subject to change at any time.

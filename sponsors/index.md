## Sponsorship opportunities

The Central Ohio .NET Developers Group (CONDG) works completely off of donations from sponsor companies.

We strive to provide the best available speakers for the user group presentations and we cannot allow
sponsorship to dictate the speaker choices. We ask that you understand this as you consider sponsorship.

### Sponsorships levels

We offer several levels of sponsorship:

**Prize Sponsorship** - You may donate any amount of giveaways that amount to at least $50 in value.
These giveaways will be raffled off at a meeting of our choosing. The group organizers will make a
special announcement that the item was donated by your organization. You are also welcome to
provide a single flyer to be placed on a table in the foyer of the meeting area

**Meeting Sponsorship** - For covering the cost of food and drink at one of our meetings, your company
will be highlighted as the official sponsor during the pre-meeting slide deck. You will be allowed to 
introduce your company to the user group. Additionally, you may bring a single flyer to be laid on a table
in the foyer of the meeting area.

**Special Speaker Sponsorship** - You may work together with the CONDG board to arrange to bring in a
special speaker to the group. This might be where you already have a well-known expert in town that
you have engaged for your own internal project. We will individually recognize you as the organization
that made it possible for us to bring in the special speaker in the pre-meeting slide deck as well as during
the Swag giveaways. All travel and expenses are the responsibility of the sponsor organization as the
cost of Sponsorship.

**In-Kind Sponsorship** - Sometimes companies or individuals may provide a special service to
the CONDG group which will earn them Honorary Sponsorship benefits. This includes companies like
Microsoft who have been graciously providing us with a place to hold our meeting free of charge.

In-Kind Sponsors receive benefits as determined by the directors of CONDG, on a case by case basis.
Sponsorship payments can be made via invoice or credit card. Please contact us to make arrangements.
You can see our list of current sponsors on our Sponsors page.

**Job Postings** - Our current policy is to not allow job postings or announcements on our site or at our
meetings.

**Questions?** - If you have any questions about sponsorship opportunities, please [contact us](/about/#contact).

These policies are subject to change at any time.

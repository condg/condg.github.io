### Arena Tech Night

Arena Tech Night is all about Technology, Community, Fun, Food and Drinks.  It is for people who are passionate about technology, and enjoy networking with others who share that same passion.  As a community-driven event, Arena Tech Night attendees help drive the process: attendees suggest topics they would like to learn about, they help gather presenters for those topics, and then they vote on which topics they would most like to see next.

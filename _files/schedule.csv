"August 25th, 2011",Presentation,Going Independent 101: Lessons learned from a decade of independence,"Breaking free from the confines of the cubicle farm and going out on your own can be one of the most satisfying things you do for your career. It can also be one of the most terrifying. This session will answer the most common questions I’ve been asked over the years such. These questions include “How do I get started?”, “Where do I find clients?”, “How much do I charge?” and many others. Come find out if the grass really is greener on the other side.",Michael Eaton,mjeaton,http://www.mjeaton.net/blog/,,"Michael Eaton has been developing awesome solutions using Microsoft tools and technologies since 1994, but in 2001 he broke free from the confines of the cube farm to go but on his own. While he lives in the middle-of-nowhere Michigan, he serves clients throughout the mid-west. Well known for his dislike of web development and box lunches, his focus over the past few years has been on XAML-based technologies like WPF and Silverlight. He speaks at regional events and user groups, runs the Kalamazoo X Conference and helps with the Ann Arbor Give Camp. He is also a C# MVP. When not working on projects or spending time with his family, he treats his World of Warcraft addiction with ample doses of time on his XBox 360."
"August 25th, 2011",Grok Talk,Succeeding with ATDD in the Enterprise,"This code-heavy presentation will focus on the new developer features of the Windows Phone 7.1 release (codename Mango). We’ll cover topics like Augmented Reality, Search Extensibility, many of the sensor APIs (like camera, gps, gyro, and compass), and, of course, multi-tasking. This presentation definitely assumes some knowledge of Silverlight or Windows Phone development, but you’ll learn plenty if this is your first exposure to the technologies too.","Bramha Ghosh, Andrew Vida",,,,

"September 22nd, 2011",Grok Talk,Windows 8 from 30K feet,"Heard the buzz last week about Windows 8? What’s Metro & what’s Retro? We take a very brief deep-dive into some of the architecture, inspiration & strategy that went into Windows 8, and then try to make sense of WinRT. We also do a little lap around the development platform & see how our skills carry forward in the new world!",Samidip Basu,samidip,,"Windows 8, Metro, WinRT","Samidip Basu (@samidip) is a technologist & gadget-lover working as a Manager & Solutions Lead for Sogeti out of the Columbus Unit.

###### Topic


What’s New for the Windows Azure Developer? Lots!!


###### Abstract


This summer has seen several major updates to the Windows Azure platform – perhaps some of the most significant updates since Windows Azure was released! It all started with the Meet Windows Azure event in San Francisco on June 7th, and continued into TechEd. Getting most of the press, and rightfully so, was the announcements pertaining to the functionality now available in Windows Azure Web Sites and Virtual Machines (IaaS). These are without a doubt “game changing” in the cloud computing and Windows Azure space. There were also announcements related to Cloud Services (formerly known as ‘Hosted Services’ – the traditional PaaS offering), SQL Database (formerly SQL Azure), and Windows Azure Active Directory (which now includes Access Control Services). During this session we’ll review many of the new Windows Azure features, and even explore some of the new functionality now available via the Windows Azure APIs and tooling updates.

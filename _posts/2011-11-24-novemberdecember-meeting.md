###### Topic


Real world Conference data &amp; a Windows Phone App!


###### Abstract


Heard about OData empowering Mobile solutions? Think cloud augmentation is mostly for hobbyists? Well, come join us for the next CONDG meeting and we shall see how some of these newer technologies helped solve a real world problem. Fresh off the press is Columbus's own Mobile Conference "M3 Conf" ([http://m3conf.com](http://m3conf.com)/). We shall take a quick deep-dive into how we exposed the conference catalog as a data feed &amp; in general, how to set up an OData service. We look into how Azure fits in the picture. But, what good is a data feed without Mobile apps? So next, we peek inside the making of a Windows Phone M3 conference app. Talking points would include how to consume and hydrate/rehydrate OData in an app, flipping Live Tiles both in-app &amp; pinned and other real word Windows Phone development tips. Hope you enjoy!

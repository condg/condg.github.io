## Topic

Building Robust Infrastructures for Windows Azure

## Abstract

Deploying custom application development projects to the Microsoft Azure cloud offers organizations a number of benefits versus conventional on-premise hosting. However, targeting applications to this new environment requires a number of fundamental changes to how software is built and managed.

In this demo-focused presentation, we will look at the changes a team will need to make to effectively target this new production environment. We will focus on the available tooling to simulate a cloud environment on development PCs, the establishment of staging/test environments, configuration & database management, and the automation of Azure product deployments.

The Microsoft Azure offering is designed to support an easy transition for existing development teams. Paired with these new approaches for the cloud, you can successfully prepare your developments teams to be Azure ready.

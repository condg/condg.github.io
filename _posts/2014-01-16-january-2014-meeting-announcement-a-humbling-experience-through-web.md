## Topic

A Humbling Experience Through Web Accessibility

## Abstract

*“We are sending him on a treasure hunt.”* Said Bob Robertson-Boyd, our product analyst, after our accessibility test. *“The more cues we can give upfront, the more successful he can navigate around the interface.”*

Visually impaired/legally blind folks navigate software in ways most of us, developers, are oblivious to. As a software engineer, watching an accessibility test can humble you pretty quickly. In this session, we will discuss our humbling experience with accessibility at OCLC while working on WorldCat.org and WorldCat for local institutions. We will explore accessibility automation tools and screen readers, discuss best practices to achieve better usability, and uncover accessibility myths and misconceptions. We will also share insight into baking accessibility in the development workflow. Last but not least, developing empathy can only happen when you're in someone’s shoes (experiencing something first/second hand). So, we will work through live demos of accessible/inaccessible apps.

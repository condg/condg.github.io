## Topic

Building Effective Distributed Applications Easily with Web API

## Abstract

Distributed computing is a reality that most developers have to deal with these days. The mobile form factor is huge! While the platforms (iOS, Android, Windows 8) are radically different, the method of delivering data to applications on these devices doesn’t have to be. How do you create one set of back-end services that can provide and consume data from all three of these platforms?

Companies have realized that one of their most valuable assets is their data. But how can that data quickly and easily be put in the hands of the people who can utilize it?

The answer to both of these questions can be found in RESTful web services. In this session you learn how REST services work, where their interoperability comes from and how to quickly build your own rest services using Microsoft’s ASP.NET Web API framework.

## Meeting Topic

Build and Publish a Windows 8 Game in 1 Day, even without Windows 8

## Abstract

Building a game for the Windows 8 platform can be fun, but there are challenges: Where do I start? What if I don’t have experience writing Windows 8 apps? What if I don’t own a Windows 8 machine?

Construct 2 can help. This game development tool runs on Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8; and requires no knowledge of C# or Visual Basic. Construct’s graphical environment allows developers to build a rich 2D computer game without writing code. In this session, students will learn how to use Construct2 to create a game; how to export their game to a Windows 8 project; and how to submit that game to the Windows 8 app store.

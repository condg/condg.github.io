## Topic

Angular for .Net Developers

## Abstract

As software developers we should always be striving to give our users the best experience possible. It should be intuitive, responsive and above all fast! With traditional web technologies, creating applications that appear “fast” to the users can be difficult. To solve this problem developers have been finding new and creative ways to leverage the browsers client-side functionality. One of the most popular frameworks for creating a web application with powerful client-side front end functionality is Angular. Angular is a powerful client side data framework that lets you bind and manipulate data easily in a way that seems lightning fast to your users. And the best part is you don’t need to be a JavaScript ninja to use it! This session will show you how to leverage Angular with your ASP.NET MVC application to create applications that your users will love and you’ll love to build.​

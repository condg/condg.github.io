## Topic

So You Think You Know Javascript

## Abstract

Many folks think they know JavaScript. They know the syntax and can manipulate the DOM. Maybe they have even used jQuery. But do they really know it? I thought I did until I started digging and discovered that JavaScript is more than just a toy language for web pages. It's a full-fledged functional programming language chock full of richness. In this session, targeted at false beginners, you will be introduced to some of this richness in an exciting game show format -- complete with prizes. You will learn about functions, objects, closures, and revealing modules. And you'll leave a more informed JavaScript programmer (unless, of course, you already knew JavaScript in which case you'll just leave with a prize).

## Speaker

Guy Royse works for Pillar Technology in Columbus, Ohio as an agile coach and software engineer. He has programmed in numerous languages -- many of them semi-colon delimited -- but has more recently been working with Ruby and JavaScript. He is also the chief organizer for the Columbus JavaScript User Group and is active in the local development community.

In his personal life, Guy is a hard-boiled geek interested in role-playing games, science fiction, and technology. He also has a slightly less geeky interest in history and linguistics. In his spare time he volunteers as Cubmaster for his kids' Cub Scout Pack.

###### Grok Talk

Simplifying front-end development with MVVM and Knockout.js

## Abstract

For years, Web developers have been working with JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery, MooTools, and Prototype.js / Scriptaculous. We all love how easy it is to create animations, effects, select and manipulate DOM elements, make Ajax calls, and so on. However, tasks that seem trivial become repetitive and can turn into maintenance nightmares later on. I will show you a better way for creating highly-engaging, highly-interactive, and maintainable Web applications by using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in JavaScript. This pattern is not just for Silverlight and WPF developers. It is made possible for client-side JavaScript by Knockout.js!

## Speaker

Mario J Vargas has worked as a Web developer for over 12 years. He is passionate about TDD and Microsoft .NET technologies, with a special preference for ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC. He is Senior Microsoft Solutions consultant at Cardinal Solutions (Columbus, Ohio), where he runs an internal multi-discipline user group called "AppDev". He's an amateur astronomer and occasionally he's seen out in his backyard looking at the sky on a nice, clear night with or without his reflector telescope.

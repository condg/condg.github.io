## Topic
Building Metro Style Applications in Windows 8

## Abstract
The recent announcement of Windows 8 and the Metro interface has caused a lot of excitement. It has also raised a lot of questions for .NET developers. What’s WinRT? Does this mean that .NET or Silverlight or WPF are going away? Will my existing .NET skills transfer over to this new paradigm? What happens to desktop applications? How do I write Metro style applications?

This presentation will answer all these questions and give developers a better idea of where Windows is heading in the future. You will see how to develop Metro style applications using both HTML 5/JavaScript stack as well as with C# with XAML. You’ll see how Metro style applications are fundamentally different from traditional desktop applications and discuss the attributes of a quality Metro style application.

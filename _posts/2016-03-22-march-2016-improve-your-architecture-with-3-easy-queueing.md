## Topic

Improve Your Architecture with 3 Easy Queueing Patterns

## Abstract

Do you want to improve your software by adding responsiveness, scaling, and loosely coupled architecture? Queueing systems based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) can help you achieve that. It can be intimidating to get started, but with the right tools, it doesn’t have to be. In this session, we will review the basics of how a queuing tool like RabbitMQ works. You will learn how an opinionated library like EasyNetQ for .NET handles the details of RabbitMQ so you don’t have to. Queuing is demonstrated in an open-source project to reduce performance bottlenecks on a web server. This session will give you a basic understanding of how and why to use queuing systems. You will leave with confidence, knowing that queuing doesn’t have to be complex. This session will use C# examples, but the general principles can be applied in other languages.

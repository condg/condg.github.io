## Topic

Chasing the Top Performers in DevOps

## Abstract

DevOps is such an abused word.  It's even worse than the all-too-common "We do Agile."  So what does DevOps really mean, and what does a company look like that truly embraces DevOps?  You know several of them: Amazon, Netflix, Target, Walmart, Nordstrom, and Facebook, just to name a few.  So what are they doing, exactly?  And how could your company become more like them?  Note: this is not a technical deep dive.  It's about how companies are transforming their culture to beat their competitors by leveraging IT as a strategic capability, and focusing on things like shorter delivery cycles, increased deployment frequency, faster time to market, and higher quality.

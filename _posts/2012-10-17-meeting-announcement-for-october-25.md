## Topic

Debunking SharePoint Development Myths

## Abstract

A lot of people have some misconceptions about what SharePoint development is. So lets debunk those myths! In this meeting, I'll cover some SharePoint development myths, debunk them, and show some code samples. Additionally, I'll show what is new from a SharePoint 2013 development side (seriously, some cool/fun stuff!). The need for SharePoint developers is pretty high right now... we will talk about how you can leverage your existing skills to develop for SharePoint. Hope to see you there!

## Speaker – Matt Huber

I’m a SharePoint guy, MCPD in SharePoint, Gamer, and Golfer. I started out development with ASP.NET/HTML on an intranet team in a local financial services company. We implemented SharePoint and ever since, I've been having fun with it. I've since moved on to Consulting for SharePoint and have been loving it! I also develop C#, however I stick mainly in the SharePoint space for that type of development.

###### Grok Topic

Acceptance Test Driven Development with SpecFlow

###### Grok Abstract

From requirements to executable tests using SpecFlow Unit testing and TDD are fairly common practices these days for .Net developers who are focused on delivering high quality code that fulfills business requirements. ATDD is also becoming a more common practice these days, especially in the agile/Scrum world. ATDD provides a means for the non-developers on the team to contribute directly to the testing effort via a structured format for writing requirements. In this session we'll briefly discuss an overview of ATDD, then quickly jump into the mechanics of using ATDD to deliver executable tests via SpecFlow.

## Meeting Topic

Patterns of Effective Test Setup: Object Mother and Beyond

## Abstract

Writing clean, effective and manageable tests begins with the "fixture", the set of data used in the test. If you've ever struggled with writing the "arrange" part of a test, or if you've ever looked at someone else's "arrange" and had a hard time understanding it, then you've suffered the pains of poor fixture setup.

In this session you'll learn a collection of patterns and techniques that will help you write smaller, more expressive tests that are easier to read, understand and maintain. We'll talk about common "fixture smells", how to construct test data, and how to save that data into the database for integration tests. Although code samples will be in C# and nUnit, this is a patterns and practices talk and is relevant to other platforms too.

"Clean setup begets clean tests". Let me show you how.

## Speaker – Seth Petry-Johnson

Seth has been programming for 24 years, the last 17 of them professionally. He got "test infected" in 2004 and since then have practiced TDD on multiple projects small and large. Most recently he has been focused on clean, testable code in ASP.NET NVC, Ruby and JavaScript. He loves bringing order to chaos and sharing his experiences with others

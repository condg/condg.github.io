## Topic

Stop Writing Secure Code! (Start Building Secure Frameworks)

The best way to build secure systems is to stop writing security-related code on a daily basis.

Developers have their hands full with complex business rules, technical edge cases, responsive UIs, etc. Security requirements are repetitive to implement, hard to test, and often get crowded out by other demands. When developers handle security on a feature-by-feature basis the result is a wildly inconsistent mess of security holes.

In this session developers and architects will learn real-world techniques for designing security into the application framework itself, rather than leaving it up to individual features. You’ll see how to implement access control in your data access layer, declaratively handle permission checks with Attributes, use PostSharp to create new "hooks" to tap into, and automate security audits using Reflection. Come learn how secure software design can dramatically reduce the day-to-day burden of secure coding.

Code samples will be in C# and ASP.NET MVC but many techniques have parallels in other platforms.

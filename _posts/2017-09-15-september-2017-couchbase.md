## Topic

5 Popular Choices for NoSQL on a Microsoft Platform

## Abstract

If you are thinking of trying out a NoSQL document database, there are many good options available to Microsoft-oriented developers. In this session, we’ll compare some of the more popular databases, including: CosmosDb, Couchbase, MongoDb, CouchDb, and RavenDb. We’ll look at the strengths and weaknesses of each system. Querying, scaling, usability, speed, deployment, support and flexibility will all be covered. This session will include a discussion about when NoSQL is right for your project and give you an idea of which technology to pursue for your use case.

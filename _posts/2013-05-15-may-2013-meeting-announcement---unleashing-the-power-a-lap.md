## Meeting Topic

Unleashing the Power: A Lap Around PowerShell 3.0

## Abstract

As developers, we have the power to make our end users’ lives a lot easier by developing applications, tools, and other software that may automate their processes or make certain aspects of their jobs more accessible. PowerShell 3.0 has a lot more functionality for us as developers to leverage in making our end users’ experiences easier. In this session, we will look at the new features of PowerShell 3.0 – including Windows PowerShell Web Service, Windows PowerShell Web Access, and Microsoft Script Explorer.

## Grok Talk Topic

Introduction to Micro-ORMs

## Abstract

Entity Framework, NHibernate, and Linq To SQL are powerful frameworks that have been leveraged for several years. They became a beacon of hope from writing repetitive SQL queries, paging through record sets, and digging around for some stupid #TempTable issue in a stored proc. Are we now choosing these frameworks to just avoid the hassle of dealing with data access. There are circumstances where you do not need the overhead involved with these large ORM's. Small lightweight applications and performance critical projects still exist, but we do not want to go back to hand writing SQL for every call. Introducing the shiny new Micro-ORM. Actually they are not that new, but they are gaining more attention. This will be an introductory overview of a few Mico-ORM's that may get you and your DBA back on speaking terms. We will be discussing Massive, Dapper, ORMLite, and PetaPoco with several free code samples to take home to your friends and family.

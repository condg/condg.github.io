## Topic

Flying High with Xamarin!

## Abstract

Cross-platform mobile development has been democratized for .NET developers – 
thanks to Xamarin & Microsoft. Let’s build a cool aviation app together – 
targeting all platforms from the comforts of Visual Studio on Windows or Mac. 
Real world apps need cloud data connectivity, navigation, storage, lifecycle 
management and polished UI – let’s do all that. Let’s look at some tooling for 
professional Xamarin developers. Let’s dip into device capabilities, reuse 
libraries and elevate the user experience. Oh, and we will throw in some 
passion for aviation in the app, like private jets and supersonic 
possibilities. Loads of fun while learning cutting-edge mobile development – 
you in?

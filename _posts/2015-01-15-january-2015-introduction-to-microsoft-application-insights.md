## Topic

Introduction to Microsoft Application Insights

## Abstract

Standby for one of our most exciting cloud-based development services. Whether you are in production or development, Application Insights for Visual Studio Online offers a set of developer services to give you a “360 degree view” with actionable insight into the availability, performance and usage of your server and client/device application, regardless if they run on-premises, in Microsoft Azure, a third-party cloud provider, or a combination of all three. This is fully server-side which can report the health of your specific service or application directly, having the reports instantaneously accessible in your Azure Portal. With Application Insights you can quickly pinpoint the root cause, and connect yourself to a rich diagnostic experience in Visual Studio. And by knowing what your customers are doing with your application, you get the insights to continuously improve your applications and prioritize investments. Join us to see how development teams get better insight to their applications and answer questions such as: How would you translate the metrics captured by Application Insights to help solve technical and business problems? Can Application Insights captures most of its data without any change to your application’s code? Can we add your own application metrics? Can we also use it to add more value to your Visual Studio Online load tests?

## Topic

The Business of You - 10 Steps to Running Your Career Like a Business

## Abstract

Smart businesses come up with a mission, vision, and values that define the way that they do business and help them focus for success. So why don't we apply the same ideas to our own lives and careers? I'll go over ten steps that you can take to run your career like a business, take control of your life, and help you work towards a successful life and career on your terms.

## Speaker

Hi, I'm Jon Kruger and I am an independent consultant in Columbus, OH. I specialize in software solutions, project leadership, and Agile coaching and training and I have experience in a wide range of industries and environments. I use my experience as a leader and software developer to find ways to create better quality software, improve the software development process, and maximize value for the business. On the side, I run the Columbus ATDD Developers Group and provide test-driven development training ([tddbootcamp.com](http://tddbootcamp.com/)).

## Grok Topic

Visual Studio 2012 By Air

## Grok Abstract

Imagine traveling to Paris for business with no time to visit trendy attractions. The solution--a helicopter tour! Are you heads down on your day job? Are you struggling to manage a personal life besides? And what's this Visual Studio 2012? Why should I care, and who has time to learn it? Have no fear! Take a high-altitude tour of the goodness Visual Studio 2012 promises early adopters, late adopters, and whenever-I-get-around-to-it adopters. With enough bullet points to supply a small army, you'll be armed with exciting teasers and useful resources to get started.

If you only have 30 minutes to see Paris, join the ride. You can catch all of the bistros and cafés the next time.

## Grok Speaker

When Jeff Miller's cousin Bill passed along his used Tandy TRS-80 to Jeff, neither realized the full significance. What started as a hobby quickly became a passion and later a career. Now, Jeff possesses more than 15 years of professional consulting experience serving the needs of state government, insurance, higher education and healthcare industries, among others. He specializes in Microsoft Web and database platforms to pay his mortgage, but also dabbles in Linux, Drupal and wiki platforms. Now, all these years later, Jeff has realized that "one man's TRS-80 is another man's treasure!"

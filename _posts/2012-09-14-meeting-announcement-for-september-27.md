###### Grok Topic

Visual Studio 2012 By Air

###### Grok Abstract

Imagine traveling to Paris for business with no time to visit trendy attractions. The solution--a helicopter tour! Are you heads down on your day job? Are you struggling to manage a personal life besides? And what's this Visual Studio 2012? Why should I care, and who has time to learn it? Have no fear! Take a high-altitude tour of the goodness Visual Studio 2012 promises early adopters, late adopters, and whenever-I-get-around-to-it adopters. With enough bullet points to supply a small army, you'll be armed with exciting teasers and useful resources to get started.

If you only have 30 minutes to see Paris, join the ride. You can catch all of the bistros and caf√©s the next time.

###### Grok Speaker - Jeff Miller

When Jeff Miller's cousin Bill passed along his used Tandy TRS-80 to Jeff, neither realized the full significance. What started as a hobby quickly became a passion and later a career. Now, Jeff possesses more than 15 years of professional consulting experience serving the needs of state government, insurance, higher education and healthcare industries, among others. He specializes in Microsoft Web and database platforms to pay his mortgage, but also dabbles in Linux, Drupal and wiki platforms. Now, all these years later, Jeff has realized that "one man's TRS-80 is another man's treasure!"

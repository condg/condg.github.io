## Topic

Yes, You Can Write Angular and React Applications in Visual Studio!

## Abstract

Are you a .NET developer who prefers to work in the Visual Studio IDE? If so, you are not alone. Many .NET developers have such an affinity with the Visual Studio that, occasionally, they forget that it's just an IDE and not .NET itself. And it's easy to see why, after years of development, tuning, and tweaking, Visual Studio has become the gold standard when it comes to software development IDE's. Everything you need is right there. Except, the development world is continuing to move toward JavaScript-based client-side application frameworks for their web-based applications. And if you think Visual Studio Code is "nice" but you miss the power of Visual Studio, you are not alone. The good news is that you can have your cake and eat it too. That's right; you can build amazing Angular and React application in Visual Studio. In this session, I'll introduce you to the built-in tooling and show you some great plug-ins that will make your development even easier. I'll explain what differences you will see in the code structure Visual Studio uses that the various CLI's, templates, and starter projects for Angular and React use. And by the end of the session, you be ready to start writing the next great Angular or React application, IN Visual Studio!

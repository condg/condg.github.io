## Topic

JavaScript LevelUp

## Abstract

If you've been developing for the web any length of time, you've probably written some JavaScript. You know the basics of the language and you can get things done, and applications shipped. But as the proliferation of JavaScript continues into frameworks like UnderscoreJS, KnockoutJS, AngularJS, AnyOtherThingYouCanThinkOfJS, and even to the server (with NodeJS) you may find yourself struggling to understand how to write professional, full-fledged applications using JavaScript. In this session you will LevelUp your JavaScript skills by learning about closures and how they help to modularize your javascript. Prototypal inheritance and how you can extend JavaScript and you will learn about JavaScript design patterns and how they can take your JavaScript skills to the next level!

## Speaker - Lee Brandt

He has led teams in small and large companies and always manages to keep the business needs at the forefront of software development efforts. He speaks internationally about software development, from both a technical and business perspective, and loves to teach others what he learns. Lee writes software in Objective-C, JavaScript and C#… mostly. He is a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in Visual C# and one of the directors of the Kansas City Developer Conference (KCDC). Lee is a decorated Gulf War veteran, a husband, a proud pet parent and loves to play the drums whenever he gets any spare time.

## Topic

More Personal Computing with Smart APIs

## Abstract

With the explosion of the cloud comes the explosion of compute power to solve complex problems. We have been playing with artificial intelligence for many years. Cloud services are now powerful enough that you can begin to build AI into your applications as simply as adding a reference to an API and a few lines of code. In this talk, we will explore and demo a few cross-platform APIs for building smarter and more personal experiences into your applications.

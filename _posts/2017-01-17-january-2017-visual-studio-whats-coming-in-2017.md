## Meeting Topic

Visual Studio…What’s Coming in 2017

## Abstract

Every day, developers are faced with new challenges for assimilating technology, developing and deploying applications with ever newer technologies and changing architectural approaches. Visual Studio 2017 looks to streamline the flow of code to deployment from fundamental tasks like unit tests to challenging deployments in the cloud. In this talk we will look at what makes VS2017 a compelling choice for "Any Dev, Any App and Any Platform". From mobile to cloud, Game to Website, Windows to Mac, you can get just what you need to get the job done.

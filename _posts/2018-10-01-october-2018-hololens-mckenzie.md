## Topic

Unraveling Realities: Building HoloLens Apps With Unity & C#

## Abstract

As the universe of immersive technologies expands, it's easy to get overwhelmed and sometimes confused not only by device choice and experience, but also by terminology. In this session, as we discuss virtual, augmented, and mixed realities -- what they mean, how they're used, and where they overlap -- you'll discover how to build your own personal reality for HoloLens, the wearable, self-contained, holographic computer. You don't even need a device to get started! Create an experience in the Unity 3D engine, which supports C# for programmatic manipulation of objects. We'll then step through the process for building Unity projects as Universal Windows Platform (UWP) solutions, maintaining them in version control, and deploying them for testing to the HoloLens emulator in Visual Studio.

## Speaker - Jeff McKenzie

Jeff McKenzie has worked in software development for nearly twenty years, in both freelance and full-time capacities, as a developer and team leader. He enjoys helping others solve problems through technology, whether it's the small business getting on the web for the first time, or a Fortune 500 company expanding its enterprise. Although he started his career using BASIC on an Atari 800, he took a big detour, getting Biology and English degrees before rediscovering programming, with a new thing called the World Wide Web. He is currently Principal Consultant at Cardinal Solutions Group in Columbus Ohio.

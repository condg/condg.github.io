## Topic

Microservices on Azure Service Fabric: What, How, and Why

## Abstract

Over the last year, Azure Service Fabric has matured and become a fantastic option for businesses and developers seeking highly available solutions with requirements that cannot be met by standard Azure Services, or are looking to build or modify applications to better manage scalable services.   
Let’s talk about how you can take advantage of Service Fabric to build a robust application consisting of small, independent services that scale rapidly and easily.  We’ll discuss the microservice approach in development (it’s not just SOA!), how Service Fabric makes this implementation easy, and finally the pros and cons of building your application in Service Fabric.

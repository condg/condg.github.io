## Topic

TDD Double Feature: How I Learned to Love Dependency Injection & Isolate Your Tests with Mocks

## Abstract

In this presentation James will combine two of his most popular presentations to demonstrate the concepts, techniques and tools around two crucial practices in Test Driven Development.

Tightly coupled applications lead to heartache. They are difficult to manage. They are difficult to maintain. The create applications that are inflexible. They make TDD, or even TAD (Test After Development) all but impossible. You've probably heard fancy terms like "Dependency Injection" and "Inversion of Control" but what do these mean and can they really help you write better applications and make testing easier? The bad news; this knowledge is a MUST HAVE for most testable applications these days. The good news, they are simpler than you think and besides simply making your code testable will also lead to good architecture practices that will help you develop better applications.

An important goal of Test Driven Development (TDD) is to be able to isolate your code under test. This means the method and class you are testing at any given time should not interact with other classes or external resources like data stores or web services. So how do you test code that relies on these things? You use mock objects to stand in for them! This session will explain the basics of mocking including the different types of mocks (mocks, stubs, fakes, etc.). You will see how to use a mocking framework to make your test writing fast, easy and more dependable. You will also learn some good patterns for creating and using mocks and shown some anti-patterns to avoid. Lastly, you'll be shown how to introduce mocking and unit testing into an environment that was not really designed for it.

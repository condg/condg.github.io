## Meeting Topic

AOP for You and Me

## Abstract

Cross-cutting concerns are everywhere: caching, logging, transactions, and more. These can make your code a tangled, scattered mess.

In this presentation, I will define cross-cutting concerns, and show you techniques to refactor cross-cutting concerns, including dependency injection; the decorator pattern; and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) tools like Castle DynamicProxy and PostSharp. I'll explain the benefits and trade-offs of each design decision so that you will be confidently prepared to master cross-cutting concerns.

## Speaker – Matthew D. Groves

Matthew D. Groves is a guy who loves to code.  It doesn't matter if it's "enterprisey" C# apps, cool jQuery stuff, contributing to OSS, or rolling up his sleeves to dig into some PHP.  He has been coding professionally ever since he wrote a QuickBASIC point-of-sale app for his parent's pizza shop back in the 90s.  He currently works from home on the Telligent product team, and loves spending time with his wife and 2 kids, watching the Cincinnati Reds, and getting involved in the developer community.  He is the author of Aspect-Oriented Programming in .NET (published by Manning), and also teaches at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. You can learn more about Matthew by following him on twitter [@mgroves](http://twitter.com/mgroves), or visiting [http://crosscuttingconcerns.com](http://crosscuttingconcerns.com)

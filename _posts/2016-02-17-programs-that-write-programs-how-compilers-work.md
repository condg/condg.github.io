## Topic

Programs that Write Programs: How Compilers Work

## Abstract

Compilers are the bridge between the code you write and the applications you run. While production compilers can be quite complicated, the principles of compiler design are not too hard to learn, and are broadly applicable to many seemingly difficult programming problems. In this session you will learn how every phase of a real compiler works, including lexing, parsing, type checking, optimization, and code generation. The lessons learned here will help you with many common programming problems, such as deserialization, maintaining large amounts of legacy code, static analysis, testing, and validation. Full source code for a working compiler targeting the .NET CLR will be included.

Craig Stuntz is a software engineer and a lifelong student of computer science, with specific interests in programming languages, type theory, compilers, and math. He lives in Columbus, Ohio, works for Improving Enterprises, and cofounded the Columbus branch of Papers We Love, a reading group for people interested in academic computer science research. In the past year he has presented talks at Lambda Jam, CodeMash, CloudDevelop, Dog Food Conference, Stir Trek, and many user groups. When not at work or playing with his kids, he is usually studying math or playing Irish traditional music on the tin whistle and wooden flute.

## Topic

Sprache: When Regex Just Won't Cut It

## Abstract

I love regular expressions. I really do. But they're not always the right tool for the job. Sometimes they're overkill. Other times, regular expressions are just not powerful enough. This is where Sprache comes in.

Sprache is a .NET library that allows you to easily and succinctly define the grammar you need to support. It projects raw text into a fully-constructed object graph in exactly one step. Sprache excels at parsing DSLs, fixed-width data formats, and markup languages. By the end of this session, you'll have an awesome new tool in your toolbelt. And as an extra bonus, you'll understand why the secret of LINQ is monads.

## Speaker â€“ Brian Friesen

Brian Friesen has been pretending to be a developer for the last 9 years and lives in constant fear of being found out. He still can't believe he's been a C# MVP since 2014. As an occasional public speaker, he prefers to talk about things that are slightly out in left field. He lives near Detroit and works for a seriously great company, Quicken Loans.

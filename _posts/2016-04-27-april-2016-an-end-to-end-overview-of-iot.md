Interested in learning more about the Internet of Things (IoT) but not sure how it fits into your business? Want to avoid some common pitfalls on your first IoT project? Join us for a look at practical, real-world IoT solutions. We’ll take a balanced, end-to-end approach, discussing all the key aspects of IoT solutions, from planning an IoT concept, to the devices, to connectivity and processing, to advanced analytics and presentation -- with many lessons learned along the way. We’ll also discuss case studies of real-world IoT projects, and how to build similar solutions using Azure’s IoT Suite.

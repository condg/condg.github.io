## Topic

Chef in the Real World

## Abstract

Chef is a wonderful tool for automating the deployment of enterprise level application, but it is not perfect. From dealing with SQL Server clusters and multiple configurations for the same service to multiple bus and multiple environment machines, the real world is much more than “Hello World” programs. In this talk, I will discuss how my team worked to implement chef to deploy a legacy enterprise level application. The wrong paths we took and how we eventually straightened them out. I hope after this session, you come with a greater appreciation of what it means to deploy your application and how Chef can help you do it.

Just like your ‘all night college’ study sessions….intense and fun. We, at Leading EDJE, thrive on having a good time at work. We deliver off the charts technical, project and program management solutions. And, we do it, because it’s what we love. Whether we are working as a team on the project, or as the solo ‘super geek’ at a client, we all work together. Our monthly brainstorming, cell diminishing meetings give our clients and our family the collective experiences of all of us. Part of becoming our client’s trusted advisor is about having a passion for developing the best solution and enjoying the process. We have a team of ‘full-timers’ meaning we are all salaried FTEs. To our clients, it means stability. They don’t have the knowledge of their systems tied to an individual, rather they know we have their back. To our team, it means an incredible, steady support group and no ‘OMG’ moment when you hit the beach. We’ve got each other's back!

We also would like to thank our yearly sponsor [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.com/) and our In-Kind sponsor [Microsoft](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx)

## Topic

Mobile Websites in ASP.NET MVC 4

## Abstract

Mobile is no longer a developer niche. In the upcoming year more mobile devices will be sold than PCs. For web developers this means the era of targeting a handful of browsers and resolutions is ending. In response, many web frameworks have added features to support mobile. One such is ASP.NET MVC. In this talk, we will demonstrate how easy it is to get a mobile solution up and running using ASP.NET MVC 4 and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using this approach.

## Speakers

He has written and given talks on a broad-range of Microsoft-related technology topics. Though recently his interest has been focused on the changing technologies that power the web.

Brad Isbell is a software developer at Leading EDJE and heads up the mobile studio. With 10 years of experience creating applications for a wide array of industries, he approaches tools and technologies open-mindedly.

## Topic

Mobile Websites in ASP.NET MVC 4

## Abstract

Mobile is no longer a developer niche. In the upcoming year more mobile devices will be sold than PCs. For web developers this means the era of targeting a handful of browsers and resolutions is ending. In response, many web frameworks have added features to support mobile. One such is ASP.NET MVC. In this talk, we will demonstrate how easy it is to get a mobile solution up and running using ASP.NET MVC 4 and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using this approach.

## Speakers - Josh Harrison and Brian Isbell

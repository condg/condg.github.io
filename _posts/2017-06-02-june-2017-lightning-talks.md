This June 22nd we will be hosting an all Lightning Talk meeting and you can be one of the presenters!

## What are Lightning Talks?

A Lightning Talk is a short 10 to 15 minute presentation on a single topic or idea. All you need to do is pick a topic you would like to present and put together a few slides and one or two short demos. Please no live coding!

## Who can give a Lightning Talk?

We allow anyone to give a talk on any technical topic that the presenter would like to share with the .Net community. No previous speaking experience is required!

If you have never given a talk before, doing a Lightning Talk is a great way to get started. You can try your hand at public speaking without having to put together a full-length presentation.

For seasoned speakers, Lightning Talks are a nice way to test out new material and ideas in front of an audience.

## How do I sign up?

If you are interested in doing a Lightning Talk, please send an email to contact@condg.org with your topic by Monday June 19th.

We have room for six speakers and it is first come, first serve. Hurry and submit your talks now!

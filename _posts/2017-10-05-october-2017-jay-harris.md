## Topic

Design for Non-Designers from a Non-Designer

## Abstract

Elegant design requires talent, but talent is not a prerequisite for avoiding bad design. If you lack artistic touch and prefer rules and logic over the ethereal art form, the fundamental tenets of composition can enable you to apply Design as a programming paradigm. Spend an hour with a coder learning the logic of design—hacking pixels instead of bits—and free yourself of your excuse for horrible designs.

## Speaker - Jay Harris

Jay is a code wrangler, software consultant, and co-owner of [Arana Software](http://aranasoft.com). He has been developing on the web since 1995, when the Blink tag lured him away from Visual Basic 3, and has been awarded as a Microsoft Regional Director, ASPInsider, and Microsoft MVP. Recognizing that the greatest application performance bottleneck is a developer’s time, Jay’s continuing quest is for frameworks, modules, tools, and practices that make developers stronger, fitter, happier, and more productive.

Originally from Rochester, New York, Jay resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. Follow him on Twitter at [@jayharris](https://twitter.com/jayharris).

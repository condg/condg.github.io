## Meeting Topic

Architecting the Internet of Things

## Abstract

There is undoubtedly a lot of hype around the Internet of Things, with a flood of products and services coming to market. Examples range from devices for tracking personal activities, to monitoring your home, your car, your business, or even the world. So how do these work behind the scenes? In this presentation we’ll discuss a real-world activity tracking system in detail: how it is designed and architected using various cloud components, and how its architecture has evolved over time so that it can scale for higher capacity at a lower cost. We will also discuss the many lessons learned along the way, as well as plans for the future

## Speaker – Vince Fabro &amp; Nick Martin

Vince Fabro is the Practice Manager of the Enterprise Microsoft Solutions practice at Cardinal Solution’s Columbus, Ohio, branch.  Vince loves building things and fixing things, and working with teams to achieve success.  He’s been applying those passions to the IT industry for well over 20 years now – the past 20 as a consultant wearing many hats (developer, trainer, architect, mentor, manager).  As a former certified trainer he has enjoyed training hundreds of students, and has presented technology topics at IT conferences and user groups for many years.  Vince has specialized in Microsoft’s .Net technology stack for more than a decade now, and is always striving to learn more effective ways to build applications that solve challenging IT problems.  Vince attended The Ohio State University to earn both his Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and his Master of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering.  He thoroughly enjoys his work, as well as bicycling, skiing, and traveling with his family.

Nick Martin is a senior consultant at Cardinal Solutions, with 10 years of experience developing and architecting enterprise applications.  Nick is passionate about helping clients get the most out of their development efforts through following best practices and Agile processes.  He also helps lead an internal development user group to help bring out the passions and share the expertise of his colleagues.  He recently started his toughest project to date: developing a decent human being (fatherhood).

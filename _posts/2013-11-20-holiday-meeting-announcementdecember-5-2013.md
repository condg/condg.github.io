OK...so a lot of people have been asking..."Since the fourth Thursday is Thanksgiving, when is the CONDG meeting this month."



CONDG's "Annual Holiday Meeting" will be held on December 5, 2013...you won't want to miss this one.



We will have some great giveaways, food and networking as well as a couple of short presentations. We're still working on exactly what those will be (lightning talk style presentations), but the atmosphere will be a time of fun.



Did I mention the giveaways...we're going to repeat what we did last year!      
CONDG and many of our sponsors are stepping up with some great giveaways, and we're trying to make sure everyone walks away with something. Here's the deal...You'll get one ticket just for coming. Additionally, you will get one ticket for every new toy you bring for "Toys for Tots" or \*bag\* of non-perishable food items (note: this is not one ticket per item) for the local food pantry (up to a total of 5 additional tickets). This means you can get a total of six chances to win something very nice. This is our way of giving back to our community as well. Last year we gave over 65 new toys and over 800 pounds of food. Let's set a new record this year!



As part of our meeting, we will also be holding elections for next years'      
officers. As announced at our October meeting, if you are interested in running for office, please send an email to "contact@condg.org" and state the position you are interested in running for. Please see the By-Laws posted on the website for any additional information.



One last thing...



The location will be at one of our Annual Sponsors' offices to accommodate a larger crowd and more activity...Improving Enterprises near Easton.

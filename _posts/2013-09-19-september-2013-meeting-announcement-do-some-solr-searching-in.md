## Topic

Do Some Solr Searching in Your Apps

## Abstract

You've designed your application, built it up, and it's working great.  One of the last features to implement is searching and reporting.  You think you can get away with just implementing some SQL LIKE statements for an initial search, but you need to search across many fields or perform complex grouped searches (like in Amazon that shows search counts by subcategory).  You've put it off because you really don't want to deal with SQL Server Full-Text Indexing - maybe it's not your cup of tea or maybe it's just intimidating or maybe you're not using something other than SQL Server.  But there are alternatives to Full-Text Indexing that can be just as powerful and fairly simple.  Solr is one such open source tool to help you with your application's searching needs.  We'll take a look at the Solr project, how you can get it up and running very easily, how you can install it as a Windows Service (as opposed to a command window), and how you can use program against it RESTfully and using Solrnet.  We'll look at basic searches along with some cool features like faceting, highlighting and rankings. If time permits, we can also look at how Solr can also complement a NoSQL environment.  You won't believe how easy incorporating Solr into your application can be!

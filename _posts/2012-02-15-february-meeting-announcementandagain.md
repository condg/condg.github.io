## Topic

Introduction to TDD

## Abstract

Test Driven Development (TDD) has been one of the biggest and most compelling paradigm changes to software development of the past few years. The ability to bake quality into your application as you develop it can change the way you think about software; it effects the way we approach, design and write applications. Test Driven Development is powerful. Yet many developers allow themselves to be intimidated by what they perceive as added complexity. Managers worry that the practice of "test first" will delay development. This presentation will explain the concepts behind TDD, outline the benefits, give you some concrete examples and some advice on how to sell it to your managers.<u></u><u></u>

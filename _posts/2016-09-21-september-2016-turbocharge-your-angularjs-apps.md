## Topic

Turbocharge Your AngularJS Apps

## Abstract

AngularJS helps developers create powerful client-side, single page applications. One of its benefits is its ability to automatically detect changes to your models and propagate them to the rest of the application's views and to any subscribed listeners. Creating templates, controllers, and reusable components, with some learning, can become a breeze and joy to implement. But if you're not careful, your application will fail to scale as it gets more and more complex. In this presentation I'll share with you the lessons I learned when I first worked with AngularJS and the steps I took one year later to ensure that this internal application for a national retail chain will stand the test of time. This session will cover AngularJS application performance and the techniques and tools you can apply to optimize your apps going forward. Angular version 1.x will be used and basic concepts, such as scopes will be quickly covered before diving in.

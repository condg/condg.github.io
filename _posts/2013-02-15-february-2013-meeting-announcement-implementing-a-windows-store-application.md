###### Topic


Implementing a Windows Store Application using XAML and C#


###### Abstract


In this session we will be building a Windows Store application from soup to nuts that will gather User Group meeting attendance information using ASP.Net Web API as a backend. Topics covered include creating an application from scratch, a bit of Windows RT UI guidance, DataTemplates and the Search contract.


###### Speaker – Carey Payette


I'm a Developer Evangelist for [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/).  I have over 14 years professional IT experience in industries ranging from government, to private sector and utilities.  I've held multiple titles through this time including support developer/technician, data architect, software developer, software architect and enterprise architect. I'm an ASPInsider and a recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in Client App Dev from 2009-2011. I also serve as the Treasurer for the National GiveCamp organization and am a member of the [StirTrek](http://stirtrek.com/) organizing committee.  I am a mom to 3 fabulous boys (+ a dog and three lizards), a black belt in TaeKwonDo and enjoy coding for fun.  I also find it extremely weird to write bios in the third person when I'm the one writing it!

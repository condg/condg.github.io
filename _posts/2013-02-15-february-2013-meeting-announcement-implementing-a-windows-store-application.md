Implementing a Windows Store Application using XAML and C#

In this session we will be building a Windows Store application from soup to nuts that will gather User Group meeting attendance information using ASP.Net Web API as a backend. Topics covered include creating an application from scratch, a bit of Windows RT UI guidance, DataTemplates and the Search contract.

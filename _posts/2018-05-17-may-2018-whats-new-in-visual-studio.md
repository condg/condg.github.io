## Topic

What's new in Visual Studio and C# 7

## Abstract

Visual Studio is a consistently great tool for developing applications on the Windows platform. In this talk we will discuss the productivity improvements added to Visual Studio 2017 that make it even better.

Along with the improvements to Visual Studio, C# was also improved. We will also talk about the new language features introduced in C# 7. Starting in December of 2015, C# 7 was developed in the open with involvement from the community. We will talk about the results of that process.

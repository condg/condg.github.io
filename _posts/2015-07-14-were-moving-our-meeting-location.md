We have always been very thankful for being allowed to meet each month at the Microsoft Office, but unfortunately for the next few months we will have to move our meeting location while renovations are being done in the Microsoft Office.



We would like to thank our sponsor [ICC](http://icctechnology.com/) for graciously offering to provide us a space to host the meetings for the new few months.



Their office is located on the north side of town by I270 and Cleveland Ave.

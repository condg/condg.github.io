## Topic

Chrome Developer Tools: Raiding the Armory

## Abstract

The Chrome Developer Tools are absolutely packed with features. Some are incredibly useful. Some are just plain surprising. For example: Turn the browser into an editor, fuzzy search source filenames, display data in the console in tabular format and much, much more. In this session, we will fix up the storefront for Wacky Wanda’s Wicked Weapons and learn some console wizardry in the process. In the course of our tribulations we will correct styling problems, enhance our debugging skills, and clean up server-side snafus.

## Speaker - Greg Malcolm

Greg is an Application Developer/Consultant working for ICC. He is a polyglot developer who loves experimenting with new languages and frameworks. In recent years he's been focussing more and more on Javascript related frameworks. If you’re wondering about the accent, everyone speaks like this in the southern foothills of Columbus.

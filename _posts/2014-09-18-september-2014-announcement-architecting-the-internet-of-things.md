## Topic

Architecting the Internet of Things

## Abstract

There is undoubtedly a lot of hype around the Internet of Things, with a flood of products and services coming to market. Examples range from devices for tracking personal activities, to monitoring your home, your car, your business, or even the world. So how do these work behind the scenes? In this presentation we’ll discuss a real-world activity tracking system in detail: how it is designed and architected using various cloud components, and how its architecture has evolved over time so that it can scale for higher capacity at a lower cost. We will also discuss the many lessons learned along the way, as well as plans for the future

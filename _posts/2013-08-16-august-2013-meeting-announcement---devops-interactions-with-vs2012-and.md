## Meeting Topic

Dev/Ops Interactions with VS2012 and Team Foundation Service (TFS in the cloud)

## Abstract

In today’s world of software development the demands are going up. We must deliver faster, higher quality, and more secure applications. Our users don’t draw the distinction between an operations failure and an application code failure, and neither can we. We will need more reliable infrastructure, more responsive actionable data from production, and more collaborative evolution of our environments. We must build trust and cooperation between all aspects of our team to accomplish this. In this talk we will focus on how several of the historic problems can be conquered. We will leverage the ALM tools in the Microsoft stack to help make this interaction and collaboration more effective.

## Speaker – Josh Harrison

Hello CONDG Members!

Due to circumstances out of our control, we are unable to use our regular meeting location at the Microsoft Office for tonight’s meeting.

We are actively working on finding a new location for the meeting but if we are unable to, we will be forced to cancel the meeting.

Please check back here later today for an official announcement about the status of tonight’s meeting.

We ask that you please help us spread the word on social media to help us notify all our members.

Thank you!
The CONDG Board

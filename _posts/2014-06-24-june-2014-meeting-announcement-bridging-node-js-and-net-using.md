## Topic

Bridging Node.js and .NET Using Edge.js

## Abstract

Are you a .NET developer who wishes to jump into Node.js, but can’t abandon the .NET infrastructure in your organization? Are you a Node.js developer who needs access to libraries in the .NET world? Edge.js makes it possible to run Node.js and .NET code in one process, allowing interop between the two. In this talk we’ll explore ways to leverage the best of both worlds.

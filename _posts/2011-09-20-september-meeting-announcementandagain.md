###### Topic


What’s new in Windows Phone Mango


###### Abstract


This code-heavy presentation will focus on the new developer features of the Windows Phone 7.1 release (codename Mango). We’ll cover topics like Augmented Reality, Search Extensibility, many of the sensor APIs (like camera, gps, gyro, and compass), and, of course, multi-tasking. This presentation definitely assumes some knowledge of Silverlight or Windows Phone development, but you’ll learn plenty if this is your first exposure to the technologies too.


###### Speaker

He’s especially proficient in user interface design, web standards and mobile application development. In addition to his developer evangelist role for Microsoft, Jeff contributed to the O’Reilly title Windows Developer Power Tools on the subject of code validation services, and is currently authoring a Windows Phone development book due out in November 2011. He also serves as an organizer for the CodeMash and Stir Trek conferences. On the academic front, Jeff holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology from Ohio’s Bowling Green State University.


###### Grok Talk Topic


Windows 8 from 30K feet


###### Abstract


Heard the buzz last week about Windows 8? What's Metro &amp; what's Retro? We take a very brief deep-dive into some of the architecture, inspiration &amp; strategy that went into Windows 8, and then try to make sense of WinRT. We also do a little lap around the development platform &amp; see how our skills carry forward in the new world!

## Topic

What’s new in Windows Phone Mango

## Abstract

This code-heavy presentation will focus on the new developer features of the Windows Phone 7.1 release (codename Mango). We’ll cover topics like Augmented Reality, Search Extensibility, many of the sensor APIs (like camera, gps, gyro, and compass), and, of course, multi-tasking. This presentation definitely assumes some knowledge of Silverlight or Windows Phone development, but you’ll learn plenty if this is your first exposure to the technologies too.

###### Grok Topic

Windows 8 from 30K feet

###### Grok Abstract

Heard the buzz last week about Windows 8? What's Metro & what's Retro? We take a very brief deep-dive into some of the architecture, inspiration & strategy that went into Windows 8, and then try to make sense of WinRT. We also do a little lap around the development platform & see how our skills carry forward in the new world!

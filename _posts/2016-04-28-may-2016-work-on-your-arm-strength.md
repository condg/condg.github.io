## Topic

Work on Your ARM Strength

## Abstract

Automation is a critical factor in successful cloud projects. Successful projects are able to skillfully craft deployment templates and scripts that provision nearly all needed resources. While Azure Resource Manager (ARM) provides a robust “infrastructure as code” approach to managing Azure resources, getting started can seem like a daunting task. In this demo heavy session, we will dive deep into creating re-sources and manipulating ARM templates. We will review proven techniques you can apply to your Azure projects. In the end, you will have a series of tips you can use to unlock new and powerful ways to manage your Azure resources.

Sorry for the delay in this announcement, we had to do some last minute speaker shuffling.

## Topic

Going Independent 101: Lessons learned from a decade of independence

## Abstract

Breaking free from the confines of the cubicle farm and going out on your own can be one of the most satisfying things you do for your career. It can also be one of the most terrifying. This session will answer the most common questions I've been asked over the years such. These questions include "How do I get started?", "Where do I find clients?", "How much do I charge?" and many others. Come find out if the grass really is greener on the other side.

## Speaker - Michael Eaton

Michael Eaton has been developing awesome solutions using Microsoft tools and technologies since 1994, but in 2001 he broke free from the confines of the cube farm to go but on his own. While he lives in the middle-of-nowhere Michigan, he serves clients throughout the mid-west. Well known for his dislike of web development and box lunches, his focus over the past few years has been on XAML-based technologies like WPF and Silverlight. He speaks at regional events and user groups, runs the Kalamazoo X Conference and helps with the Ann Arbor Give Camp. He is also a C# MVP. When not working on projects or spending time with his family, he treats his World of Warcraft addiction with ample doses of time on his XBox 360.

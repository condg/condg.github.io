###### <font size="2">Abstract</font>


For many developers the dream of creating a video games is what inspires them to begin their journey into code. They go to college where they learn business oriented languages like C# and Java, they develop a knack for OOP and Line of Business development; their C++ knowledge atrophies, while their .Net knowledge grows and matures. Thanks to Unity3D these line of business developers can return to their original love of game development and bring their C# and .Net knowledge with them. We will be covering the basics of using the free version of Unity3D, while we look at developing our own 2D Game.

###### Topic


Gadgeteering


###### Abstract


By day, you are a master of the TPS report creation and all things virtual that make your bosses look good. By night, you create all sorts of marvelous electronic gadgets to aid you in your secret life of fighting crime. Or at least you would, if you could just get past all the hassle of correctly connecting up all the hardware and just focus on the programming. Well now you can, thanks to Microsoft .NET Gadgeteer, an open-source toolkit for building small electronic devices using the .NET Micro Framework and Visual C#. I’ll show you how to build and program your first device so you can finally begin your career as a crime fighter. Costume, faithful sidekick and cool superhero name not included.

###### Topic


Journey into Robotics with Netduino


###### Abstract


Brian and Stephen (father and son) have spent the last five years off and on working with Robotics and Electronics. Stephen started with Lego Mindstorms, got deeper into electronics with SnapCircuits and the Parallax Basic Stamp and finally convinced his dad that Arduino was the next big thing. As a .Net developer, Brian joined in with the Netduino platform and C#. Together, they have explored electronics and robotics with the goal of creating a remote control robot with .Net and Kinect. They will be bringing their current robot project and showing steps/missteps along the way.

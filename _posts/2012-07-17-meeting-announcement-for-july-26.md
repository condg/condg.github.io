Gadgeteering

## Abstract

By day, you are a master of the TPS report creation and all things virtual that make your bosses look good. By night, you create all sorts of marvelous electronic gadgets to aid you in your secret life of fighting crime. Or at least you would, if you could just get past all the hassle of correctly connecting up all the hardware and just focus on the programming. Well now you can, thanks to Microsoft .NET Gadgeteer, an open-source toolkit for building small electronic devices using the .NET Micro Framework and Visual C#. Iâ€™ll show you how to build and program your first device so you can finally begin your career as a crime fighter. Costume, faithful sidekick and cool superhero name not included.

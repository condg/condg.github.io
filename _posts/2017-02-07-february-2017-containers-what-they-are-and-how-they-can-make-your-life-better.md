## Topic

Containers: What they are, and how they can make your (dev) life better

## Abstract

Containers are a very hot topic these days, and with good reason.  But if you’re new to containers the learning curve can be challenging.  What are containers?  Why would I use them?  Is this container thing a fad, or is it here to stay?  Using containers can greatly simplify your deployment strategies.  Have you ever had problems with dependencies when going to production?  Have you ever needed to push your changes through environments and *know* that what you delivered is the same through each environment?  Container technology can help you do this.  
 
In this intro to containers, we’ll discuss how they’re an amazing DevOps approach.  Come and see how containers can make your developer life easier.

## Topic

First Class Test Code

## Abstract

Whether you test first, in parallel, or "eventually", some things remain the same. The need for tools and techniques that allow us to test edge and corner cases, and the need for maintainable, reusable testing code. In this session, we'll cover some interesting tools from Microsoft Research, Pex and Moles. Pex provides for automated identification and testing of edge and corner cases in code, while Moles allows you to test dark corners that were previously untestable. We'll also cover some common principles, patterns, and practices to help make your unit and integration testing code easier to understand and maintain in the long run.

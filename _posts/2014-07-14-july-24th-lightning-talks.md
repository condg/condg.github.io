Once again we are very excited to announce that this July 24th we will be hosting an all Lightning Talk meeting and you can be one of the presenters!   
  
**What are Lightning Talks?**   
  
A Lightning Talk is a short 10 to 15 minute presentation on a single topic or idea. Several talks will be presented in a row to the audience.

**Who can give a Lightning Talk?**   
  
We allow anyone to give a talk on any technical topic that they are interested in and would like to share with the .Net community. No previous speaking experience is required!

If you have never given a talk before, doing a Lightning Talk is a great way to get started. You can try your hand at public speaking without having to put together a full length presentation.

For seasoned speakers, Lightning Talks are a nice way to test out new material and ideas in front of an audience.

All you need to do is pick a topic you would like to present and put together a few slides and short demos that can be completed in 10-15 minutes.

**How do I sign up?**  

If you are interested in doing a Lightning Talk, please send an email to [contact@condg.org](mailto:contact@condg.org) with your topic by Monday July 21st.

We have room for 6 speakers and it is first come, first serve. Hurry and submit your talks now!

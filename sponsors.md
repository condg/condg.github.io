## Sponsorship opportunities

The Central Ohio .NET Developers Group (CONDG) works completely off of donations from sponsor companies.

We strive to provide the best available speakers for the user group presentations and we cannot allow
sponsorship to dictate the speaker choices. We ask that you understand this as you consider sponsorship.

**Prize Sponsorship** - You may donate any amount of giveaways. These giveaways will be raffled off at
a meeting of our choosing. The group organizers will make a special announcement that the item was 
donated by your organization. You are also welcome to provide a flyer to be handed out.

**Meeting Sponsorship** - In order to provide a consistant location and meeting time we are willing to work
with potential meeting sponsors that can commit to providing the following reqirements for a minimum of 6 months:

1) Classroom style seating for 60+ people
2) Full audio / visual capabilites for presentations
3) Provided food and drinks for guests
4) Free or validated parking (bonus)

**Job Postings** - Our current policy is to not allow job postings or announcements on our site or at our
meetings.

**Questions?** - If you have any questions about sponsorship opportunities, please [contact us](/about/#contact).

These policies are subject to change at any time.
